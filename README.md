# Open Handwashing

## What does this project do?

Open Handwashing is a device to help people wash their hands better and prevent the spread of disease. It works by controlling the timing of soap and water delivery.

## Why is this project useful?

Guidelines for proper handwashing are published by many public health organizations, such as [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html), the [WHO](https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html). Unfortunately, it is always tempting to rush and not follow them properly. This project aims to promote correct handwashing technique by prompting users at each step of the process and making sure that they do not rinse their hands too early.
