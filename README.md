# Open Handwashing

## What does this project do?

Open Handwashing is a device to help people wash their hands better and prevent the spread of disease. It works by controlling the timing of soap and water delivery.

## Why is this project useful?

Guidelines for proper handwashing are published by many public health organizations, such as the [WHO](https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/), [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html). Unfortunately, we often rush and don't fully follow them.

## How do I get started?

This project is Open Source Hardware, so please build and test!
