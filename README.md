# Open Handwashing

## What does it do?

Open Handwashing is a simple control system to help people wash their hands better and prevent the spread of disease. It works by controlling the timing of soap and water delivery.

## Why is this useful?

Guidelines for proper handwashing are published by many public health organizations, such as [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html), the [WHO](https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html). Unfortunately, it is always tempting to rush and not follow them properly.

This project aims to promote correct handwashing technique by prompting users at each step of the process and making sure that they do not rinse their hands too early.
